# Code for manuscript "SETBP1 variants outside the degron disrupt DNA-binding and transcription to cause a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder"

`rnaseq-analysis_HDF.Rmd` is an Rmarkdown file with multiple code chunks, which will read bam files, create a count table, preprocess data for differential expression (DE) analysis, perform DE analysis, and visualize results. The script has in-code comments explaining each step. Users must adapt the script (input and output paths) to their own data and research purposes.

Codes for count table generation and differential gene expression analysis were adapted from a course manual (Computational Analysis of RNA-Seq Data Seminar and Practical Course, LMU Munich, 2018).
